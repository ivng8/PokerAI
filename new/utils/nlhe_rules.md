# 6-Max No-Limit Hold'em Poker Rules and Strategy

## Game Format
- 6-max (or 6-handed) poker games allow a maximum of six players at the table
- Positions in 6-max: Lowjack (LJ), Hijack (HJ), Cut-Off (CO), Button (BTN), Small Blind (SB), Big Blind (BB)
- More hands per hour compared to full-ring (9-handed) games
- Larger average pot sizes and higher percentage of players seeing flops

## Basic Rules
- Each player is dealt two private cards (hole cards)
- Five community cards are dealt face up in the middle of the table
- Players make the best five-card hand using any combination of their hole cards and community cards
- Betting occurs in four rounds: pre-flop, flop, turn, and river
- Players can bet any amount from the minimum bet up to all their chips (no-limit)

## Position Importance
- Position is extremely important in 6-max NLHE
- Players in later positions (CO, BTN) have informational advantages
- Opening ranges get wider as position improves
- Small blind typically has the widest opening range but worst post-flop position

## Opening Ranges
- Opening ranges should be position-dependent
- Early positions (LJ, HJ): Tighter ranges with strong hands
- Late positions (CO, BTN): Wider ranges including more speculative hands
- Recommended open-raise size: 2.25-3x the big blind (3-4x from SB)

## 3-Betting Strategy
- 3-betting serves multiple purposes: value, bluffing, and isolation
- Value 3-bets: Strong hands seeking to build the pot
- Bluff 3-bets: Hands with blockers or good removal effects
- Isolation 3-bets: Targeting weak players to play heads-up

## Post-Flop Strategy
- C-betting on the flop is a fundamental strategy
- Double barreling on the turn when appropriate
- Position dictates aggression levels and continuation frequencies
- Multiway pots require more caution and stronger hands

## Adjustments for 6-Max
- More aggressive play compared to full-ring
- Higher 3-bet and 4-bet frequencies
- More bluffing opportunities
- Greater emphasis on hand reading and exploitative adjustments
